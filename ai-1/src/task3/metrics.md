## âœ… Post-Optimization Performance Metrics Checklist

After moving heavy computation to a Web Worker, use Lighthouse or WebPageTest to measure the following:

| Metric                             | Target Value              | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**      | Less than **200 ms**      | Measures how much time the main thread was blocked by long tasks (>50ms).  |
| **First Input Delay (FID)**        | Less than **100 ms**      | Time from user input to response. Should be minimal on page load.          |
| **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**| Less than **200 ms**      | Measures interaction responsiveness. Lower is better for UX.               |
| **Main Thread Work**               | As low as possible        | Indicates CPU time spent on the main thread. Lower means less blocking.    |
| **Time to Interactive (TTI)**      | Less than **5 seconds**   | Time until the page is reliably interactive. Lower is better.              |

> ðŸŽ¯ Aim to keep all values within recommended Core Web Vitals thresholds for a smooth user experience.
